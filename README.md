# Definition Webscraper

It takes the given Excel file, and it fills out the vocab based on the first column.

The spreadsheets I received in the assignment had its columns laid out like this:
A. Word (already filled in by professor)
B. Part of Speech 
C. Definition 
D. Conjugations 

The program fills out the part of speech, definition, and conjugations.
